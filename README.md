# Hardhat Graph Plugin

POC for a Hardhat plugin that aims to help smart contract/subgraph developers automate away mundane repetetive tasks involved with subgraph development, so that they can focus on the logic of their dApps and leave the infrastructure to Hardhat and The Graph!

More info on the project can be found on this [forum post](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/hardhat-graph-plugin/2863).

To test the plugin out:
- clone this repo
- run `npm install` to get the needed dependencies
- run `npm run build` to build a template subgraph for the Greeter contract provided by Hardhat by default
- run `npm run build-subgraph` to build the subgraph
